Customer Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report Purpose:
          This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviour

Highlights:
       1. Gather essential fields such as customer names, age and transactions details
	   2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups
	   3. Agregagates customer-level metrics such as:
	      - total orders
		  - total sales
		  - total quantity purchased
		  - total products
		  - lifespan (in months)
		4. Calculate valuable KPIs such as:
		   - recency (months since last order)
		   - average order value
		   - average monthly spend
